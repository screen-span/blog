<p>But wait, one of the fundamental properties of a computer, really any machine, is that it’s deterministic, that it produces the same output if you feed the same input. The solution here is to use a property of mathematics, not a property of the computer. If you’ve studied mathematics, you’ve probably heard of modular arithmetic, and even if you haven’t, you’ve certainly used it before, in the form of division with remainder.</p>

<p>When you try and divide a number by another smaller number, one thing you’ll notice is that it doesn’t always work. There’s usually a little bit left over, called the remainder, that you have to subtract off to get an even fit. A property of these remainders is that, given the right divisor, and the right dividend, you can get a remainder that’s uniformly distributed over the possible values. This way of making random numbers, known as a congruential generator, still has flaws.</p>

<p>For example, these numbers are called pseudo-random numbers, since you can always predict the next number given all the parameters, since computers, by their definition, are deterministic.
I didn’t know you were supposed to just go and make things. There was always a method, some piece of knowledge that I lacked. Hell, I had read tons of guides to making videos and comics and blog posts. But it feels wrong, it feels chaotic, to go and make these things yourself.</p>

<p>That’s wrong. It’s not that these things feel wrong to make or create, they feel pretty good to bring into the world. What feels insane is releasing them, throwing them out into the world for people (admittedly, very few), real people to see. That’s the part that feels crazy and that’s the part that’s the most difficult to overcome.</p>

<p>What’s even more difficult is overcoming that in personal relationships, it just feels so wrong to text or call or email people directly, to encroach upon their messages or their ringtone or their inbox, to assert your existence directly, to make a small squeak of “I exist, I exist!”.</p>

<p>So, these are really one and the same: the feeling of pushing your creation into the world, and the feeling of asserting your existence to others. The sad truth is that unexpressed, you simply don’t exist, and you’ll continue to not exist until you change this, because the longer you sit there, wallowing in your own mind, the harder it’ll be to escape, if you ever get to that stage at all.</p>

<p>A classic video from the eclectic Tom Scott is about lava lamps. They’re not his of course, they belong to some company in Europe. They’ve got a camera trained on a single wall, one that’s covered in the things, each squishing and undulating the balls of wax that it contains, as the camera watches silently from a couple feet away.</p>

<p>A cool feature of this wall is that it’s non-periodic - it’ll never repeat the exact same pattern in its lifetime. This property makes it perfect for creating numbers without the pesky deterministic repeating-itself part. For this reason, the company offers randomness as a service: you can access and API that lets you query for random numbers, and the website will oblige.</p>

<p>You don’t need a bunch of lava lamps though; you can do it with a lot of natural processes. An example of this is the atmosphere, which is done by random.org, which offers random numbers as a service; measuring levels of atmospheric noise that you can turn into inputs for your lotteries or your video games or your gambling sites. The creator, some dude, recognized the issues with pseudo-random number generators all the way back in the 80’s, creating the site and its mechanism as a way to overcome these limitations.</p>

<p>A concept that Zefrank talks about in his show is braincrack. In so many words, it’s what happens when you get addicted to the applause in your brain. Most ideas sound pretty good when you first think them up, and most implementations suck, just by nature of being brought into the world. Braincrack is what happens when you get more attached to how good you think the thing is going to be in your head, as opposed to how it usually actually goes.</p>

<p>There’s also Johnathan Coulton, who talks about his midlife turn as a musician, and how the birth of his daughter kick started him to get started on music, something he had lost track of over the years.</p>

<p>You don’t have to use the atmosphere exclusively as a source of randomness. You can use really any natural process, so long as it doesn’t violate the periodicity problem that we talked about before. The ocean, with its swirling, churning currents would make a great candidate for such a system of generating random numbers.</p>

<p>The inability to get to work and do things also extends to going places. It is often mind-bogglingly difficult to get a bunch of people to go to the correct place at the right time. It takes a certain amount of confidence in yourself to even get them to believe that something that you plan will actually happen, let alone that it will be fun. This trickles down to the level of taking yourself places too. It’s easy to get more caught up in the idea of going somewhere or talking to someone or doing something than it is to follow through and to do it.</p>

<p>What if I went to the ocean? With a small microcontroller, one that’s hooked up to several sensors relating to salinity and water pressure and temperature and vorticity? What if  I drove all the way to the beach and used what I’d learned, about doing things and about making things and about generating random numbers and discovered that it was possible? Not only that it was possible, but it was done and that I did it? What then?</p>

<p>So here I am, writing this post after having an idea for it sitting in class this morning. Wondering if I’ll have the courage to go places and to meet people and look them in the eye and ask questions about their lives and see things that are worth seeing and look at the sun as it sets over the water, sitting alongside someone I’ve chosen as my own.</p>

<p>Looks like the nearest beach is only forty-four minutes away. Get busy living or get busy dying.</p>
