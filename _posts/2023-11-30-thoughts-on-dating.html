<p>There’s a Paul Graham quote that I think about from time to time. It’s from a memoir of sorts that he did on his life a couple years ago. In it, he’s recounting his time on a beach, watching his kids play in the sand while he works over some problems in his head with the Lisp compiler that he was working on. The key point being something along the lines of “it felt like I was finally doing life right, and I was worried by how novel it felt”. The main thrust being, “Hey, this is really nice, but what have I been doing all my life that I’ve been missing this?”</p>

<p>I started dating for the first time about a year ago. It was a date of course, and finally a time to notice how useless it is to spend your time ruminating about things that don’t matter. I truly had been ruminating about the person I went on a date with for literal months, without the foggiest who it was I was so infatuated with. In my single conversation with her, I learned more than a thousand nights worrying and wondering and hoping, and it was a bit scary. </p>

<p> In the same way, I burned through a lot of dating discourse this year, mostly on twitter, sometimes on Instagram. Ruminating and ruminating about the insights and the thoughts and feelings of others. If I’m being honest, these made me feel more angry and frustrated than enlightened, and the nights I spent thinking about the rules and maladaptive thoughts of others, the worse I felt. </p>

<p> I lied about those other articles being helpful. There was one, with an awful title that I won’t repeat that was the most important. Though a bit long and self-indulgent (can relate), the main thing I took away was a quote about dating, saying that a relationship is about making someone happy “not forever, or as happy as they could be, but happier than they might be on their own”. I’d be lying if I said that I haven’t thought of that line almost every day since I read it, much more so now that I’m actually dating someone. </p>

<p>Did I mention I was actually dating someone? In the same vein as before, I’ve learned more by going on dates than I possibly learned in the last 20 years of my life. We met on Bumble. Quaint, I know. In the vein of referencing the terminally-online, there kind of was an “oh shit, I really like this person” moment. </p>

<p>It’s got to be some cosmic law of the universe to take any amount of dating advice from the terminally online, but I was reminded of a book review, referencing dating as a small culture, one with its own customs, habits, values, and in-jokes. Somehow, against all odds, the one I’ve stumbled into one that involves lots of compliments and going on actual dates. Happiness writes white, but holy hell it’s incredible to watch some of your dreams come true right in front of your eyes. </p>

<p>Is there some amount of arrested development. In yet another tweet, Roon said that most people in relationships end up perpetuating each others mental illnesses. I’m inclined to agree a bit. There does seem to be an amount of artistic license that you’re given once you have a breakup, but I couldn’t say whether that’s any amount of help, possibly just getting a bit meaner or a bit more muscular by going to the gym. I want to say that these are good, virtuous things to be, but Christ isn’t it nice that people are happy together, even if they inevitably perpetuate each others’ worst traits? </p>

<p>In a habit typical of the overly-online, I was reminded of a Scott Alexander blogpost, concerning different worlds. The main point that, most of the time, people tell the truth about their experiences, and that this stems from certain properties of the ways they interact with and perceive the world, creating a unique experience that attracts and binds certain personality types to themselves. These discoursers are telling the truth, just not one that’s especially helpful to anyone that’s not them. </p>

<p>Even so, they’re the mere fact that I was reading them in the first place. Was the fact that I was attracted to the places they wrote and the affect that they put off, evidence that I was closer to their target audience than I would like to admit? In a “If you’re reading it it’s  for you kind of way”. </p>

<p>Bo Burnham’s song is another thing I think about. “If you want love, just pick a girl and love her, then whip out your dick and let the girl you love decline the offer”. It’s a nice, if raunchy sentiment, that you aren’t ever really the catch you think you are (most of the time). I think it’s possibly I have some sort of flattery attraction field, that I live in a world that truly is different in a detrimental way, maybe starting with my mother. </p>

<p>In yet another fundamental truth I’ve rethought, is it truly inevitable that you have to cheat on your wife? Honestly, culture seems to want to impress on me otherwise, but this seems like an easy-as-hell thing to avoid if you’re intentional about it. Maybe is the child of divorce in me, but Christ guys, can’t you truly break up if you don’t like each other, possibly before you have a bunch of kids, pretty please? </p>

<p>The hard part is practicing what you preach, as how we spend our days is indeed how we spend our lives. You have to be the change you want to see in the world, and immediately, from the get go model the habits and the culture that you want to be as a relationship. You have to ask about their day and think about things from their perspective and pull yourself away when you get spun up. </p>

<p>But there is a dark side: narcissism. There’s the point where you get fixated on how the other person affects your perception of yourself, and how you perceive yourself in the eyes of others. Not how you’re actually seen of course, but in the twisted, fucked up way that you’ve convinced yourself that you can be seen in the first place. </p>

<p>But sometimes you can’t do it, you can’t hack it from the get go. You don’t hit the ground running, and instead trip and fall. It happens, and to a lot of people actually. You model a culture that just sucks. One that has envy and anger and loneliness as its defining characteristics. </p>

<p>What do you do in that case? The way I see it, you gave two options. The first is to tough it out. Sometime this make things better, sometimes it makes it worse. You reaffirm your vows or do a grand reset or get married. These seem to basically never work, at least not forever. The other option is to break up. To say, “this isn’t working, and we both know it”. To cut bait and troll on over to a new pond. This one, as per Falkavich and my personal experience, does seem to work. If you want to change, really change, then you sometimes have to pack up and just go somewhere else. And that’s ok. The problem only comes when you’re too stubborn to admit it, dragging it on because you have kids or because you refuse to see things for how they are. </p>

<p>In another thing, there are things you won’t like about people. I’ve seen it mentioned many times the cliche of the things you once found cute turning into the things you find infuriating. In another thing I liked from Falkovich, is the idea of seeing something you don’t like, and reinterpreting that as their artistic expression. Definitely smacks of magical thinking, but holy cow does it work to reposition your thinking from that of annoyance to that of endearment. </p>
